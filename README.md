# TempleOfAzshi

This is a 3D Logic game that was developed as the result of my bachelor thesis.
Everything in this game is handmade from textures to music and sounds.

As an adventurer you will go into the temple of Azshi, the goddes of light. It is said that those who are able to complete all the challanges that lies inside will recieve the goddess's blessing. Noone knows what really lies inside. Everyone who ever went inside and returned do not remember anything of what happend to them inside. 

Will you be able to pass all of the challanges and recieve the blessing?

You can download just the build.zip to play the game. The rest is the source code for the Unity Project.
